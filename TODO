Future work:

* Fixup README.txt so its undestrandable
* Cleanout old backups
* only send db to s3 if its changed from old backup?
* Switch to using a released version of boto when one is released with all fixes.
 - Aka first release after 2.6.0
* Sync order of scripts to match order in install-from-source.html in 1.8
