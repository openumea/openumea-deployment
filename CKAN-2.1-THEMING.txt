How to theme the site with new default style
============================================

With the new jinja2 templates, we haven't built any new theme, so we just use
some tricks in the /ckan-admin/config panel.

Here are whats done:
Site Title: OpenNorth
Style: Default
Site Tag Line: Open data from the north of Sweden
Site Tag Logo: //openumea-storage.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Opennorthlogo.png
About:
What was the air quality in 2009? What is the growth in population?
Where can you see publicly-funded art in the centre of the city? Data to
answer many, many questions like these is out there on the Internet
somewhere - but it is not always easy to find.

Opennorth is our, the municipality of Skelleftea, the municipality of
Umea, Lulea techniacl university and Umea university's, catalogue of
useful sets of data on the Internet. You can collect links here to data
from around the web for yourself and others to use, or search for data
that others have collected. Depending on the type of data (and its
conditions of use), Opennorth may also be able to store a copy of the
data or host it in a database, and provide some basic visualisation
tools.

Use the data and the power of ITC an create something that improves the
life of the citizens! Commercial or non-commercial services or products
does not matter.

Suggestions or ideas regarding what data we should provide or how the
site should work? Please mail us on info@opennorth.se! You can write in
swedish or english.
